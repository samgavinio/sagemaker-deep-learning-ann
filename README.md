## Amazon SageMaker Example

This repository contains example notebooks that show how to apply machine learning and deep learning in [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) based on the [Deep Learning A-Z Course](https://www.superdatascience.com/courses/deep-learning-az) from the Superdatacience team

### Examples

These examples provide a gentle introduction to machine learning concepts as they are applied in practical use cases.

* [Keras (TensorFlow)](https://github.com/samgavinio/sagemaker-deep-learning-ann/tree/master/ann) to create an Artifical Neural Network to predict if a bank customer will exit the bank or not based on the [ChurnModeling dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/aakash50897/churn-modellingcsv#Churn_Modelling.csv).
